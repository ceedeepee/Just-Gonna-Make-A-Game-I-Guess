-- #### How_it_Works "Example" scene ......

*First you have the spritesheet of all characters into "./Resources/ Number of character[0-100]/"
*You have the animations of all characters into "./Resources/Animations/ Number of character[0-100]/"

1ยบ Basically when you clone a character ("Return")... one prefab is instantiated ("./Resources/0") this prefab is the base prefab.
		-The character will be instantiated on "UnderGround/InstancePoint" transform.position, he starts walking and will stop when trigger with "KillPoint".
		-When the character is on stop mode... now you can kill him.
2ยบ The animator of this prefab is modified with the animations of the selected character.
3ยบ When you kill this character, the new animator will call the dying animation of this character.

About more important scripts:

MainCamera / "Main_Controller.cs" 
		*-Select the character to clone.
		*-Select death mode to kill the character.

Cloned character / "Custom_Animator.cs"
		*-Modify the animator with the new animations of the selected character.
